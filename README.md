#### Use Python customize the function and import collection and counter to counter the words. Specify the number of occurrences of each word frequency in the text files. I have uploaded the text script and csv file. If you want to test on the moudles you can download the files and moudles on local machine and run into the IDLE to see the result.
#### Part A
###### Character count: Read both files - script01.txt and script02.txt. Output the character frequency pair based on both. In doing so you need to account for letters of the alphabet only (i.e. a thru z) and by ignoring case (i.e. treat A and a, B as b, etc.). The output should be formatted as follows

#### Part B
###### Word count: Read both files - script01.txt and script02.txt. Output the word frequency pair based on both. The output should be formatted as follows (note there is a single space between the largest word and the largest count)
Are 26
Hearsay 2
Stanley 123
Interesting 1
etc.
#### Part C
###### Word count: Find the ten most frequently occurring word frequency pair for the file named script01.txt. Find the counts for those 10 words for the second input file (script02.txt). This time use the wordlist in stopwords.csv to eliminate from your counts any word that belongs to that list. Your output should be formatted as follows:
