#### Use Python customize the function and import collection and counter to counter the words. Specify the number of occurrences of each word frequency in the text files. I have uploaded the text script and csv file. If you want to test on the moudles you can download the files and moudles on local machine and run into the IDLE to see the result.
#### The result of moudle A and C will look like as following:
